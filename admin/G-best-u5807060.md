I submit the following for assessment as my best class.

* The method makeGUIPlacement() in class Board.

I declare that this is entirely my own work, with the following documented exceptions:

* The idea of and implementation of running scores (line updateScore() in makeGUIPlacement)
* and placement previews (events pane.setOnMouseEntered and pane.setOnMouseExited) are
* by Manal Mohania (more detailed authorship comments in the class itself).

* The idea and implementation of making a sound whenever a placement is made
* was by Manal Mohania (the line audio.play() in makeGUIPlacement).
* The sound was from <http://www.sounds.beachware.com/2illionzayp3may/jspjrz/SWITCH.mp3>

* All CSS styling of the buttons was done by Manal Mohania/

* The idea of being able to have two AIs play against each other was by Joseph Meltzer.

* The code for all variations of 'addPane' in class Board if heavily adapted from:
* <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31095954/how-to-get-gridpane-row-and-column-ids-on-mouse-entered-in-each-cell-of-grid-in>

* The image of the mute 'button' was from <https://pixabay.com/en/icon-loudspeaker-speaker-horn-1628258/>

* Some of the instructions were copied from <https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/125022/stratopolis>
